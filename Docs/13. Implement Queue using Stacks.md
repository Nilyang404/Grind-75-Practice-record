## [110. Balanced Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/)

Given a binary tree, determine if it is 

**height-balanced**

.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = []
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-104 <= Node.val <= 104`

### Best Practice

bf search

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def dfs(self,root):
        if root is None:
            return[True,0]
        left, right = self.dfs(root.left), self.dfs(root.right)
        balanced = left[0] and right[0] and abs(left[1] - right[1]) <= 1
        
        return [balanced, 1+ max(left[1], right[1])]
    def isBalanced(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        return self.dfs(root)[0]
```

### Approach

The approach is to implement a DFS function that returns two values for each node: whether the subtree rooted at the current node is balanced and the height of the subtree. This can be achieved using a recursive DFS traversal of the binary tree.

1. Implement a recursive DFS function, `dfs(root)`, that takes a node as a parameter.
2. Inside the DFS function, check if the current node is `None`. If it is, return `[True, 0]` to indicate an empty subtree, which is considered balanced.
3. Recursively call the `dfs` function on the left and right children of the current node, and store the results in `left` and `right`, respectively.
4. Calculate whether the current subtree is balanced by checking if both `left[0]` and `right[0]` are `True`, and if the absolute difference between `left[1]` (the height of the left subtree) and `right[1]` (the height of the right subtree) is at most 1.
5. Return `[balanced, 1 + max(left[1], right[1])]` as the result for the current node, where `balanced` is `True` if the current subtree is balanced, and `1 + max(left[1], right[1])` represents the height of the current subtree.
6. In the main function, `isBalanced(root)`, return `dfs(root)[0]` to check if the entire binary tree is balanced.

### Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)
  - The algorithm performs a depth-first traversal of the binary tree, visiting each node once.
- Space complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree
  - The space complexity is determined by the maximum height of the call stack during the recursive DFS traversal.
  - In the worst case, when the tree is skewed (completely unbalanced), the space complexity is O(n).
  - In the best case, when the tree is perfectly balanced, the space complexity is O(log(n)).
