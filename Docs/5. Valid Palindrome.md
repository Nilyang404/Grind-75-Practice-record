### [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.



### Simple

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        s = [char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum()]
        return s == s[::-1]
```



### Best Practice

two pointer→←

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        l = 0
        r = len(s) - 1
        
        while l < r:
            
            while l < r and s[l].isalnum() == False: 
                l += 1
            while r > l and s[r].isalnum() == False: 
                r -= 1
            if l > r or s[l].lower() != s[r].lower():
                return False
            else:
                l += 1
                r -= 1
        return True
```

### Approach

1. Initialize l and r as the left and right pointers.
2. While l is less than r:
   1. Increment l until it points to an alphanumeric character.
   2. Decrement r until it points to an alphanumeric character.
   3. If l becomes greater than r, return True as the string is a palindrome.
   4. Compare characters at l and r (case-insensitive):
      1. If they are not equal, return False as the string is not a palindrome.
      2. If they are equal, increment l and decrement r.
3. Return True if the loop completes without finding any mismatch.
