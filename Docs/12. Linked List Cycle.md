### [141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)



Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` *if there is a cycle in the linked list*. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)

**Input:** head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)

**Input:** head = [1,2], pos = 0
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)

**Input:** head = [1], pos = -1
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

**Constraints:**

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
- `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

### Best Practice

quick slow pointer

```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        slow_pointer = head
        fast_pointer = head
        while fast_pointer and fast_pointer.next:
            slow_pointer = slow_pointer.next
            fast_pointer = fast_pointer.next.next
            if slow_pointer == fast_pointer: # == or is
                return True
        return False  return False
```

### Approach

The idea is that we create two pointers, a slow one and a fast one. The slow pointer traverses the linked list 1 node at a time, while the fast pointer traverses the linked list 2 nodes at a time. If at some point the two pointers meet on the same node, then that means a cycle exists.

### Complexity

**Time Complexity**: O(n)O(n)O(n) — In the worst-case scenario, each node is visited once.

**Space Complexity**: O(1)O(1)O(1) — Constant space is used.

### Hash Map

```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        visited_nodes = set()
        current_node = head
        while current_node:
            if current_node in visited_nodes:
                return True
            visited_nodes.add(current_node)
            current_node = current_node.next
        return False  
```
